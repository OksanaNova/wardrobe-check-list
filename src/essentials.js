        description: "“You might think of a button-down as this old-school thing, but it’s actually the polar opposite,” Allen shares. “It’s the neutral centerpiece of an outfit, the equivalent of a white T-shirt.” Allen is quick to point out that there’s a use case for nearly every cut; the only silhouette that she cautions against is the fitted front-seam version, as it feels reserved for an older generation.",

        description: "Now, onto pants. It takes a few different styles to round out your below-the-waist lineup. First and foremost: the humble black trouser. Don’t think of it as just an office-wear piece—the trouser has limitless use cases, especially if you opt for a set. “You can wear it as shown above, then you can separate it out,” says Allen. “Or, wear the pants with a sneaker and a white T-shirt for a daytime look work, which you can just as easily elevate for an evening.” It's all about finding the right trousers that are multi-purpose and can carry you through most of the year. “If you buy a pair of white linen pants, you're only wearing those for 1 to 2 months max.”",

        description: "As basic as basic gets, straight-leg jeans are all that and more. They come so highly recommended because they go with every single shoe in your closet right now—ballet flats, kitten heels, ankle boots, you name it. What’s more, it’s the single most flattering style irrespective of body type. (Many of our editors have tried and begrudgingly returned pairs of baggy jeans that didn’t live up to our mood board vision.) “The fitted high-waist cut actually frames the body at the top. It’s also not too tight at the ankle,” which creates space for women with varying calf sizes. In short, it complements every element of the leg.",

        description: "Sweaters get a bad rap. There’s a misconception that all knits have a varying degree of frump factor. Au contraire. Brands like Khaite are churning out contemporary crewneck sweaters with abandon, shifting the narrative on the humble knit to something far fresher. White sweaters even come with the bonus ability to serve as a clean slate through winter days. “Think of this as your cold-weather white T-shirt,” Allen says. “You should use it in the very same way.”",

        description: "Over in the coat department, we have the ultimate seasonless topper: the trench. “It’s an old-school classic,” Allen says—one especially suited for gloomy, rainy days. Burberry is behind the original trench, developing it as a weatherproof option for soldiers during the first World War. It’s a classic instance of function meets fashion, one that ends with the coat transcending the trenches and living on in street style for the century following.",

        description: "“A white tee is obviously a blank slate to build your outfit upon, but it can even be the outfit in and of itself, if you're going for more of that simple Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy look,” Allen says. We have a whole exhaustive guide on the subject of white T-shirts, hand-chosen and tested by Allen herself, should you want to dive deeper. At the very minimum, we can tell you that fit and fabric are key here. Regarding fit, Allen says, “If you're going to do a crewneck, it should closely hug your neck,” and as with the aforementioned sweater, “you’ll also want to make sure the armholes aren’t too low.”",

        description: "Perhaps the most polarizing piece on this list: the bodysuit. While some are averse to the bottom-fastening situation, a great bodysuit is key to creating a clean, tucked-in look that won’t roll when you sit, as regular tops tend to. “The whole point of a bodysuit is that you don't have any bunching. They're such a great way to add an extra layer to any look,” says Allen. “It keeps things interesting and flattering.” Some of our editors have several bodysuit types in their lineup, such as boxy tees, tank tops, et cetera. The most discrete and multi-wear option is the turtleneck.",

        description: "The blazer is one of the most written-off, underrated wardrobe basics for women. Don’t think of it as an office-only piece—it can be styled corporate or casual, on- or off-duty. If you seldom have a formal occasion to wear a blazer, you may have concluded that you don’t need one—but think again. In reality, it’s the polished pieces that always make the greatest match for casual wear. In the wonderful world of styling, the combination of the two gives maximum impact. So go ahead, break from those preconceived notions and dare to wear the blazer in different contexts.",

        description: "“The cardigan is essentially a replacement for a jacket,” Allen affirms—one especially suited for occasions where a denim jacket may make sense, but may also seem like the obvious choice. Cardigans are our classic workaround. They feel a dash more thoughtful and eons more comfortable. “A cardigan over a dress during the summer is my go-to, and it’s just as critical during fall months. It's a really great layering piece before it gets too-too cold.”",

        description: "Last but not least, one of our favorite wardrobe basics for women: the cropped jacket. `It's another perfect transitional piece to use before it gets too cold and you need a full-blown coat,` says Allen. The beauty of this piece? It functions both as a standalone blazer, as shown here, and as a jacket when unbuttoned or removed to reveal the actual look. “That’s what I love about this St. John one specifically. It can be multipurpose depending on how it serves the outfit,” Allen adds. Pair the jacket with a slip skirt, T-shirt, and white sneakers for a casual errand day, or button it with straight-leg jeans and slingback heels for more polished occasions.",
